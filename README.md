# *Gold Badge Console Application Challenges*
### *by Christopher Weaver*

This application contains three console applications that follow a repository pattern.  Each repository also includes unit tests.

## Challenge 1: Cafe
In this console application, a cafe manager has the option to create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu.  A pantry repository is included for tracking ingredient costs and determining the final menu price.  This could later implement tracking for pantry inventory with the option to remove menu items when a key ingredient is depleted.

## Challenge 2: Claims
Claims department representatives for Komodo Insurance can use this console application to view, add, and process new claims.  Komodo allows an insurance claim to be made up to 30 days after an incident took place, so if the claim is not in the proper time limit, the application notifies the user that the claim is not valid.  The console includes full input verification for adding a new claim.

## Challenge 3: Badges
This application maintains a dictionary of details about employee badge information.  Doors are validated from a list of possible doors.  The user can add badges, edit badges (update doors/delete doors/delete all doors), and list all badge details.
